## Description

This is a PACMAN game with eight variations.

- 0. Classic Mode (easy or hard)
     Original gameplay.
- 1. Limited Vision Mode (easy or hard)
     The player can only see a small area around Pac-Man (the maze is covered in darkness).
- 3. Maze Transformation Mode
     The maze changes shape dynamically during the game, such as blocking or opening new passages. Every once in a while, a part of the wall moves to change the ghost's route.
- 4. Survival Mode
     The game has no points. The goal is to avoid more and more ghosts and survive as long as possible. Every once in a while a new ghost is added.
- 5. Clone Mode
     Every time the player eats a power dot, a clone is created. The clone's AI is as irregular as the ghost, but can eat dots.
- 6. Relaxation Mode
     No enemies
